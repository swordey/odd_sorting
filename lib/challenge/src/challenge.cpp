* You will need to write a function, that receives a vector of numbers.
* Your mission is to sort ascending odd numbers but even numbers must be on their places.
* Zero isn't an odd number and you don't need to move it. If you have an empty array, you need to return it.
* 
* Example:
*  sortArray([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 4]
*
* INFO: You should install the following module to make this challenge work: ArduinoSTL by Mike Matera
*       1. Go to PIO Home/Libraries/Search libraries
*       2. Search for 'ArduinoSTL'
*       3. Click on library
*       4. Click Install.
*       5. You are good to go!
