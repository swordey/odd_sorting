# Odd Sort Challenge
This is the fourth eLearninga Embedded Challenge.

You will need to solve [Dice game](https://github.com/swordey/dice_game) challenge first.

## Challenge
You will need to write a function, that receives a vector of numbers.
Your mission is to sort ascending odd numbers but even numbers must be on their places.
Zero isn't an odd number and you don't need to move it. If you have an empty array, you need to return it.

Example:
```
sortArray([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 4]
```

Have fun!
